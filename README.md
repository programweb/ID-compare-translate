**Map related genes across species**
&nbsp;

The
[g:Profiler g:Orth tool](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/orth "g:Profiler tool")
allows the user to map a list of genes (you can use gene-list.txt in this git repo) of interest to homologous genes in another related organism.

Here is an example use: getting the gene ortholog names of the mouse genome using a list of Human genes.
